      "description": "Hi my name is Nick Mullaney. I'm a software developer and chef with 17 years of leadership experience in fast paced and fluctuating environments. I'm an avid public speaker, I love sharing my knowledge with others and teaching where I can. I craft most anything that I can get my hands on from blacksmithing and leather working to writing novels. I've always been fascinated with software and computers ever since I built my first PC at the age of 10. I decided to give coding a try during the pandemic by taking some night courses and enrolled in a coding boot camp to take myself to the next level. I currently work for a food service tech company called MarginEdge as a software support specialist, which helped give me an understanding of how things work at software companies. In the short term I'm looking to join an exciting company as an entry level software developer and work my way into leadership. In the long term I'd love to lead teams that create web apps to help people who are neurodivergent.",
